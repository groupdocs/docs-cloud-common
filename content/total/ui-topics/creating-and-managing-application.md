1. Click on the [Create New Application](https://dashboard.groupdocs.cloud/applications/create) button.
1. If you have no storage created yet, let's first create one by clicking on the create button next to the default storage select box field.
1. Follow the tutorial on the [Creating and Managing Storages]({{< ref "total/ui-topics/configure-3rd-party/_index.md" >}}) page in order to setup your first storage.
1. Once you create and connect the storage, go back to the [Applications](https://dashboard.groupdocs.cloud/applications) page.
1. Enter details for new App.
1. The newly created storage will be pre-selected on the Default Storage field since it's the single storage you have.

You can view the newly created app under the **Applications** page.

## Get Client Id and Client Secret
