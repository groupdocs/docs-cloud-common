# Introduction #

[Textual ](https://wiki.fileformat.com/word-processing/txt/)documents are simple Plain Text flat files (TXT), that contain no images, pages, paragraphs, lists, tables and so on. However, users can create some primitive formatting like lists with leading markers, left indents with whitespaces, tables with pseudo-graphics, paragraphs with line breaks, and so on. GroupDocs.Editor Cloud can recognize some of these structures. Other non-obvious feature, that GroupDocs.Editor Cloud provides, is the ability to save edited TXT document not only back to TXT, but also to [WordProcessing](https://wiki.fileformat.com/word-processing/). There several steps that usage of [GroupDocs.Editor Cloud](https://products.groupdocs.cloud/editor) consists of:
|---|---|---|---|---|---

1. Upload input document into cloud storage
1. Load the document into editable representation in the cloud storage (HTML file and resources)
1. Download HTML document (and resources, if needed) from storage
1. Edit HTML document at client side
1. Upload HTML document back into the storage
1. Save the edited document into Spreadsheet format in the storage
1. Download saved document

Steps 1, 3, 4, 5 are storage operations, please refer to this [Storage Operations]({{< ref "editor/developer-guide/storage-operations/_index.md" >}})) for usage details. Step 4 is a custom edit operation that can be performed with the programming language or 3rd party tools.

Below is a detailed description of steps 2 and 6.

## Loading Text Documents ##

This REST API provides an ability to load the input documents into an editable representation.

## Resources ##

```html 

HTTP POST ~/load

 ```

## SDKs ##


Using an SDK (API client) is the quickest way for a developer to speed up the development. An SDK takes care of a lot of low-level details of making requests and handling responses and lets you focus on writing code specific to your particular project. Check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/groupdocs-editor-cloud) for a complete list of GroupDocs.Editor Cloud SDKs along with working examples, to get you started in no time. Please check the article to learn how to add an SDK to your project.
