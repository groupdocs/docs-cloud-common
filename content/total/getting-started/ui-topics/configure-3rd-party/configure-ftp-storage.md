* Access the [Storages](https://dashboard.groupdocs.cloud/storages) Page
* Select [FTP Storage](https://dashboard.groupdocs.cloud/storages/ftp/create) from the 'Create New Storage' menu
* Enter Storage Name (any name of your choice), FTP server address, user name, password and port number and check if Require explicit SSL over TLS
