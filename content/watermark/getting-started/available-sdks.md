GroupDocs.Watermark Cloud is a modern REST-oriented API, that allows easy integration into existing systems.

## Why use an SDK? ##

Using an SDK (API client) is the quickest way for a developer to speed up the development. An SDK takes care of a lot of low-level details of making requests and handling responses and lets you focus on writing code specific to your particular project.

Our supported SDKs are 100% tested and out of the box running. These SDKs are open source and have the MIT license. You can use them and even customize them for absolutely free of charge.
